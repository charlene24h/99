# Post Install
Once you have verifed that your machine boots properly without any issues as described in the "What Works section", proceed to do the following

### 1. Enable Verbose mode (the black screen with logs on boot up)A real hackintosh Users uses this.
In Config.plist, navigate to NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> boot-args and give a single space and add the `-v` argument

### 2. Disable ShowPicker
In the Config.plist, You can disable the boot picker screen so that you boot straight to th Apple logo by setting under `Misc` -> `Boot` -> `ShowPicker` False (NO)
Note: you can still see the boot picker with ShowPicker set to no/false by spamming Esc before the apple logo is displayed during boot.

 ### 3. Boot faster
You can Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & IntelBluetoothInjector.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist for BigSur.
For Monterey, Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & Bluetool fixup.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist
This is not done by default to bluetooth working.
***For those on macOS Monterey do not enable IntelBluetoothInjector kext because the system will not boot***
  
### 6. Add Device Properties for Serial number, MLB, ROM, Sytem-UUID and optionally SystemProductName.
Use `MacBookAir9,1` SMBios. Recommended : opencore configurator, Go to the  `PlatformInfo >SMBios`Tick the "Add to the section to config file" in `SMBIOS` and `DATAHUB -GENERIC- PLATFORMNVRAM` and continue your Adding your SMBIOS.
Follow this [Opencore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to set up serial number and the accompanying info to get iServices.

                                                                       
Thanks to the OpenCore Team, SAITEJA for testing, also me ofcourse.

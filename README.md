# Infinix-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore.
- This repo contains the installation guide and EFI files required to get a perfectly functional and Big Sur and later Hackintosh on your Ice Lake (10th gen) Inbook or X1,slim. Everything is stable and functional as described in the Readme.

- These are the builts from me.  You might get the future updates for this machine.

 **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and OpenCore version.**
 - **For macOS Monterey this EFI will work great as BigSur, But bluetooth is not working Only in Monterey. Tried many ways to fix but may fix later releases. so don't expect flawless functionality**
Report me If you find the bugs or any issues. And don't ask for ETA(Estimated Time of Time).

# What's Working.
- Wifi
- Working Imessages and Facetime. For these, read my [post install](https://github.com/devboloji/Infinix-Hackintosh-Opencore-Guide#post-install) which is below the installation .
- Bluetooth (Bluetooth Headphones working, also bluetooth file transfer works)
- App Store
- Onboard audio(input/output)
- USB 2.0 / USB 3.0
- Wired headphones
- You will get upto 3 1/2 hours to 4 hours battery backup for streaming 1080p-youtube and for coding without any pause.You may get more than me.
- Trackpad 
- brightness keys(To increase(+ve) -> `Pause`key) & (To decrease(-ve) -> `Scr Lk` key)
- OnBoard Audio(Input/ Output)
- Wake / Shutdown
- Short sleep. (If you make sleep for long hours, The laptop shutdowns. To boot up your device you need to plug in the charge like macbook to wake. But you can make sleep to for 1 to 3 hours(but you will lose 2 to 3 percentage for every hour when  you put your device into sleep.) 
This is due to continuous fan spinning when sleep. Anyone is welcomed to fix these issues. First contact me to do that
- Everything (Much More).
- #### Increased performance than windows and linux.(don't check benchmarks with geekbeench. You will see low scores than windows. But in performance, This macOS has great performance than windows. I have tested before, You can also test it.

## What's Not working
* Long Sleep(Using Long sleep, fans still spins and causes battery drain)(Donot use any hibernate app in macos) Any one is welcomed to fix this issue, contact me.
* Hdmi slot.
* Don't expect too much battery in this Hackintosh like windows.But you definitely get more performance sure than windows without plugin the charge in this MacOS..I have tested blender in Both OSes.Blender worked very very smooth than windows(Tested my personal project has realtime sky Nishita with blender 3.2.1.  So you can expect more performance it in My efi. Here, the performace is because of "Metal-Optimisation", but not optimised in "OpenCL".  in windows , And we don't need openCL in macos according to me..
# Bios
- Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS
- ## Disable:
- Fast Boot
- disable wake on wlan and bluetooth (which causes sleep issues)
- Disable windows bit-lock encryption (ignore, if you don't lock it)
- Secure Boot
- Serial/COM Port
- Parallel Port(if you have)
- VT-d (can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES)
- CSM
- Thunderbolt(For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)
- Intel Platform Trust (if you don't see in bios, leave it)
- CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)(This must be off, if you can't find the option then enable AppleXcpmCfgLock under Kernel -> Quirks. Your hack will not boot with CFG-Lock enabled)

- ## Enable:
- VT-x
- Above 4G decoding(if you don't see in bios, leave it)
- Hyper-Threading
- Execute Disable Bit
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off

8. Download and extract the [OpenCore Package](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) (Release version is fine).
9.Select the "macrecovery" folder in the "opencorepkg" folder at `/Utilities/macrecovery/`
10.Copy the path of the "macrecovery" folder in file manager or finder.

# Post Install
Once you have verifed that your machine boots properly without any issues as described in the "What Works section", proceed to do the following
### 0. Boot os without usb or any drive
After booting into OS, You need to downlaod opencore configurator and mount the system drive, Then paste the efi to the mounted efi from the USB or drive. then reboot and remove usb.

### 1. Enable Verbose mode (the black screen with logs on boot up)A real hackintosh Users uses this.
In Config.plist, navigate to NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> boot-args and give a single space and add the `-v` argument

### 2. Disable ShowPicker
In the Config.plist, You can disable the boot picker screen so that you boot straight to th Apple logo by setting under `Misc` -> `Boot` -> `ShowPicker` False (NO)
Note: you can still see the boot picker with ShowPicker set to no/false by spamming Esc before the apple logo is displayed during boot.

 ### 3. Boot faster
You can Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & IntelBluetoothInjector.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist for BigSur.
For Monterey, Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & Bluetool fixup.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist
This is not done by default to bluetooth working.
***For those on macOS Monterey do not enable IntelBluetoothInjector kext because the system will not boot***
  
### 4. Add Device Properties for Serial number, MLB, ROM, Sytem-UUID and optionally SystemProductName.
Use `MacBookAir9,1` SMBios. Recommended : opencore configurator, Go to the  `PlatformInfo >SMBios`Tick the "Add to the section to config file" in `SMBIOS` and `DATAHUB -GENERIC- PLATFORMNVRAM` and continue your Adding your SMBIOS.
Follow this [Opencore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to set up serial number and the accompanying info to get iServices.
### 5.To fix cursor glitch (ignore,if you are done, before installing)
Goto Bios Settings -> `Chipset Section -> System Agent (SA) Configuration -> Graphics Configuration`

Set` DVMT Total Gfx Memory` setting to `Max`
Set `DVMT PPre-Allocated` Setting to `160M` or to `max`

### 6.Fix Imessage and Facetime.
If you are new to the apple account or if you are using apple account for the first time in hackintosh, You need to use the apple account for one month and use icloud. Even though, the imessages or factime don't work..
The thing is "Use it" for a month or more and automatically after some days, Magically facetime and imessages workss...Tada...

### 7.Fix "interface is small" (small text and window issue)
- To fix, use [one key high dpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi) here and run `hidpi.command` in the folder and choose `(1) Enable HIDPI` by typing `1` -> Then choose `Macbook` -> choose  `(2) 1920x1080 Display (use 1424x802, fix underscaled after sleep)` -> Reboot your device 
-  After rebooting, go to `system Preferences` -> `Display` -> choose `Scaled` and select what you like.

These are the builts from me.  You might get the future updates for this machine.

 **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and OpenCore version**
 -**For macOS Monterey this EFI will work great as BigSur, But bluetooth is not working Only in Monterey. Tried many ways to fix but may fix later releases. so don't expect flawless functionality**

## <What's Not working>

# INSTALLATION
## macOS Bigsur Online Installer with Windows:
**This is a simple and quick summary of the online install USB creation**

Windows Guide:(Works for Macos users also)

1. Download [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
2. Select the desired flash drive or Sdcard you would like to put the installer on under the device option
3. Select `non-bootable` as the boot selection (REQUIRED)
4. Select `FAT-32` or `Large FAT-32` as the partition scheme
- **`For mac users`**
1. Launch Disk Utility
2. `Select View` > `Show all devices` at the top left
3. Select your flash drive (root usb device)and format it as `MS-DOS (FAT)` or `FAT-32`
and change `guid patition table`-> `Master Boot Record Partiton`.
5. Open up the usb partition in file explorer and delete the files created by rufus
6. Create a folder on that partiton named `com.apple.recovery.boot`
7. Install Python from Microsoft store or Download manually for MAC and Windows users here -> [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you select add python x.x to path)
8. Download and extract the [OpenCore Package](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)

- Run the command For Monterey: `macrecovery.py -b Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6 -m 00000000000000000 download`
13. This will put some files in the macrecovery folder but we only need "BaseSystem.dmg" and "BaseSystem.chunklist" (takes approx. 600mb to 800mb internet)for Downloading the Macos installer.
14. Paste both of those files in the `com.apple.recovery.boot` folder in your flash drive partiton or sdcard or pendrive.
15. Download the latest EFI created [here](https://github.com/devboloji/Infinix-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore/releases)
16. Copy the folder named `EFI` and paste it in your USB partiton, beside the `com.apple.recovery.boot`

`Note: Make sure to apply the correct bios settings before continuing (provided above)`

17. Restart your laptop and hit `F12`
18. Select your flash drive as temporary boot option
19. Now in the OpenCore menu select the name of your USB partiton
Great! Now install and set up macOS Big Sur as usual(This process will be required 14gb internet to download full Macos bigsur). When you are done be sure to read my post install guide.
